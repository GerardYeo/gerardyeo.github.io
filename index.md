I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Trusted Internet and Community [(CTIC)](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg). My research focuses on understanding how consumers perceive trust in digital environments and how these perceptions shape their behaviors.

Before joining CTIC, I developed a deep interest in leveraging machine learning to explore psychological phenomena. This led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Data Science at the [Institute of Data Science, NUS](https://ids.nus.edu.sg) in 2020. Under the mentorship of Assistant Professor [Kokil Jaidka](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/17291-kokil-jaidka) and Professor [Mike Cheung](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/people/cheung-wai-leung-mike/), my doctoral research examined cognitive-affective constructs—such as appraisals and emotions—expressed in first-person autobiographical text and how these are perceived by other readers (third-person) in the context of consumer behavior. Grounded in psychological theories, I developed computational models of these constructs using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

In addition to applied work, I have contributed to theoretical advancements in psychology. Collaborating with Assistant Professor [Desmond Ong](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/co9953) (my ex-advisor)— formerly at NUS and now at UT-Austin— we explored the theoretical foundations of emotions and published a meta-analysis on the relationships between cognitive appraisals and emotions in Psychological Bulletin.

My academic journey began at NUS, where I earned both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Social Science (Psychology) through the Concurrent Degree Programme (CDP). During this time, I worked under the guidance of Associate Professor [Ryan Hong](https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/1409-ryan-hong), investigating cognitive vulnerabilities that contribute to anxiety.

## Ongoing research
- Developing computational models of language to uncover insights into affect, cognition, and behavior, grounded in psychological theory.
- Improving social-cognitive (e.g. Theory-of-Mind) and analogical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Investigating value alignment in LLMs through model steering techniques.

My works are primarily published in CS conferences with a computational social science track (EMNLP, ACL, ICWSM, AAAI). Broadly, I am passionate about two intersecting areas: using computational methods to better understand psychological phenomena expressed in text, and applying psychological principles to improve the design and capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
