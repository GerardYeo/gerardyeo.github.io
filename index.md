I am currently a Ph.D. student under the Institute of Data Science in the National University of Singapore.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding psychological phenomena in data using computational methods. More specifically, my research revolves around understanding cognitive (e.g. appraisals) and affective (e.g. emotions) constructs in text using computational methods, informed by Theories of Emotions.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with other scholars and scientists who are interested in studying various theories of emotions (e.g. Cognitive Appraisal Theory) and its applications in understanding first- and third-person emotional experiences in text.
